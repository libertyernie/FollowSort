<p>
    FollowSort is an ASP.NET Core web app that lets you keep track of posts by
    Twitter and Tumblr users. It collects them in a notification area so you
    can be sure you don't miss anything, and it also lets you filter out
    reposts and/or non-picture posts.

                For Tumblr, unlike other sites, FollowSort determines if a
                post is NSFW by looking at the blog that you're following.
                If you don't have NSFW content enabled, you won't receieve
                any notifications from NSFW blogs.
